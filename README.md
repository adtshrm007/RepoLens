## 🌐 Overview

> **RepoLens V2** is a full-stack Code Intelligence Platform designed to audit your technical debt, map your architecture, and flag critical security vulnerabilities in seconds. 

Unlike standard "AI Wrappers" that blindly dump source code into an LLM, RepoLens utilizes a multi-pass **deterministic engine** architecture. It performs deep structural AST parsing and lexical regex scanning entirely in-house using Node.js. LLMs are strictly relegated to a presentation layer—synthesizing our deterministic data into human-readable architecture summaries.

> ⚠️ **Note on Language Support:** Currently, the deterministic static analysis and dependency graphing engines are heavily optimized for **JavaScript and TypeScript (JS/TS)**.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

While highly optimized for speed and cost, the current "Scan Entire Repository" architecture has a few intentional trade-offs:
- **Incomplete Context:** To respect GitHub API rate limits and keep scans fast, the deep analysis pipeline only fetches and analyzes the **Top 50** most critical source files per scan.
- **Shallow Security Checks:** Security scanning relies on deterministic rules (Regex and AST parsing). This catches obvious flaws (e.g., hardcoded secrets, `eval()` usage) perfectly, but it cannot catch complex, multi-file business logic vulnerabilities.
- **Surface-Level Architecture:** Architecture summaries are deduced from dependency graphs and file names, not a deep semantic understanding of every file's logic.

---

## ⚙️ Core Engines (Not Just an AI Wrapper)

RepoLens is powered by a robust backend pipeline of independent, deterministic services:

1. **The Dependency Graph Engine:**
   - Parses code into a Babel Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - Traverses `ImportDeclaration` nodes to map cross-file dependencies and external package usages.
   - Outputs a massive, directed acyclic graph (DAG) rendered seamlessly via ReactFlow.
2. **The Static Analysis Engine:**
   - Evaluates cognitive complexity without AI.
   - Calculates exact Lines of Code (LOC), function counts, component counts, nesting depth, and largest function sizes per file.
3. **The Security Scanner:**
   - **Lexical Pass:** Blazing-fast regex checks for hardcoded AWS keys, secrets, and dangerous DOM injections (`localStorage`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
   - **Structural Pass:** AST tree-walking to detect unsafe structural implementations like `eval()` and dangerous dynamic imports.
4. **The Scoring Engine:**
   - Mathematically calculates a 0-100 Health Score by weighing technical debt (e.g., deep nesting penalties) against critical security findings.
5. **The AI Presentation Layer (OpenRouter):**
   - We **never** pass your raw source code to an LLM. Instead, we compress the findings from the engines above into a deterministic JSON schema. The LLM simply translates this dense schema into readable onboarding guides and architecture summaries, reducing token costs by ~98% and ensuring high accuracy.

## ✨ Features

### 🚀 Massive UI & UX Upgrade
- **Dark Terminal Aesthetic** — A completely redesigned interface featuring rich `#050508` dark mode, glassmorphism panels, interactive micro-animations, and custom scrollbars.
- **Universal Command Palette (⌘K)** — Instantly search across repositories, historical scans, security findings, and files.

### 📊 Explainable Health Metrics
- **Transparent Scoring** — The overall health score is now visually broken down into its four pillars: Maintainability (35%), Security (35%), Architecture (20%), and Documentation (10%).

### 🕸️ Interactive Dependency Graph
- Enhanced ReactFlow graph that maps how files and modules import each other.
- Features **Search**, **Focus Mode** (dimming unconnected nodes), and **Hide External** filters.

### 🛡️ Security Posture Panel
- Grouped vulnerability analysis featuring animated Severity Donut and Bar charts.
- Quickly filter between CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW severity risks mapped to specific lines of code.

### ⚖️ Side-by-Side Comparison
- Compare two historical repository scans to track metric regressions, security vulnerability resolutions, and architecture drift over time.

## 🗄 Database Schema

RepoLens utilizes a highly normalized PostgreSQL schema mapped through Prisma.

- **`User`**: Tracks authentication details.
- **`RepositoryScan`**: Tracks the asynchronous background scan status and timestamps (`startedAt`, `completedAt`).
- **`RepositoryFile` & `FileMetrics`**: Stores AST-parsed metrics (Lines of Code, Depth) per file.
- **`SecurityFinding`**: Tracks discovered vulnerabilities (XSS, Hardcoded Secrets).
- **`DependencyGraph`**: Stores the serialized Node/Edge JSON graph.
- **`HealthScore`**: Stores the calculated 0-100 scores.
